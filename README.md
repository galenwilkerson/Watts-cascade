# Watts-cascade

This is a shiny-server implementation of Duncan Watts' Cascade model.  Basic network statistics are displayed.
The app is running here for you to try:  https://galenwilkerson.shinyapps.io/cascades/

[Note, you must stop running the current cascade - by clicking "run cascade" a second time - to change settings and create a new network.]
